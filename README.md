# @Published for Reactive Updates in UIKit
@Published is a property wrapper in Swift that works with ObservableObject. It automatically creates a publisher that emits updates whenever the property changes. This is particularly useful for keeping UI elements in sync with data changes without requiring explicit delegate methods or manual property observers.
